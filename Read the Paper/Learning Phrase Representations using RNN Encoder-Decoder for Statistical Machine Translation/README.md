# 1) 간단한 요약(Summary)
 Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a sematically and syntatically meaningful representation of linguistic phrase. Our qualitative analysis of the trained model shows that it indeed captures the linguistic regularities in multiple levels i.e. at the world level as well as phrase level. The proposed architecture has large potential for further improvement and analysis.
 
# 2) 평가(Evaluation)
  1. Novel Idea =>  Normal.
  2. Good Motivation => Good (Improve the encoder-decoder model.)
  3. Easy to Read => Good
  4. Reproducible => --
  5. Convincing results => Good
  
# - Points in Favor
   1. Word representation
   2. Variable length sequence
   3. Use the GRU model and it makes more better.
