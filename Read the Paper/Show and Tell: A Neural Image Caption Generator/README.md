# Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator

[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4555)

## 1) Summary
In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision
and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. Furthermore, it will be interesting to see how one can use
unsupervised data, both from images alone and text alone, to improve image description approaches.

## 2) Evaluate
1. Novel Idea => Normal
2. Good Motivation => Good(Beacause the problem has long been studied but only video not image)
3. Easy to Read => Good
4. Reproducible => Good
5. Convincing Result => Good

- Points in favor
  1. Propose the NIC is based CNN-> RNNLSTM
