# Bag of Tricks for Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks
[Link arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01187?source=post_page---------------------------)

## 1) Summary
 In this paper, we will examine a collection of such refinements and empirically evaluate their impact on the final model accuracy
 through ablation study. In the literature, must were only briefly mentioned as implementation details while others can only be found in source code.
 
## 2) Evaluation
  1. Novel Idea => Normal
  2. Good Motivation => Good
  3. Easy to Read => Good
  4. Reproducible => Good
  5. Convincing Results => Good

  - Points in favor
 1. Analysis and adaptation in the feature catch-well model
 2. Infoming to normal people efficient method in Vision
